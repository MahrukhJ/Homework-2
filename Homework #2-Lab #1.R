Homework #2 - Lab #1

"Possible Protocol #1":

After rolling the die once, the result was a 3, thus allowing us to conclude that the die is fair.
Following this result, the probability for the die to be judged as unfair is 1/6. 
#This is because the probability of rolling any number is 1/6th on a fair die and rolling a 6, would presume this die unfair. 
Oppositely, if the die was unfair, the probability that it would be judged as fair is 5/6. 

"Possible Protocol #2":

#Specify a decision rule to judge if a die is fair or unfair.
For a dice to be considered fair, out of 20 rolls, the frequency of a 6 should amount to 3-5. 
(This is because if a dice is fair and given that the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6, 20/6 is 3.3 repeating and 2 more than the average is considered normal, according to our group)
