Homework #2 - Lab #1

Possible Protocol #1:

After rolling the die once, the result was a 3, thus allowing us to conclude that the die is fair.
Following this result, the probability for the die to be judged as unfair is 1/6. 
#This is because the probability of rolling any number is 1/6th on a fair die and rolling a 6, would presume this die unfair. 
Oppositely, if the die was unfair, the probability that it would be judged as fair is 5/6. 

Possible Protocol #2:
