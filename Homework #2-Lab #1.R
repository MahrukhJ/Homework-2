Homework #2 - Lab #1

"Possible Protocol #1":

After rolling the die once, the result was a 3, thus allowing us to conclude that the die is fair.
Following this result, the probability for the die to be judged as unfair is 1/6. 
#This is because the probability of rolling any number is 1/6th on a fair die and rolling a 6, would presume this die unfair. 
Oppositely, if the die was unfair, the probability that it would be judged as fair is 5/6. 

"Possible Protocol #2":

#Specify a decision rule to judge if a die is fair or unfair.
For a dice to be considered fair, out of "n" rolls, the frequency of a 6 should amount to around "n/6", give or take a certain number of rolls depending on 'n'. 
"Taking the example from HW#1, out of 20 rolls, a die will be regarded as fair if it lands on a 6, 3-7 times. 
For a die to be judged as unfair, out of 20 rolls, a die should land on a 6, 8 or more times. The number 8 was chosen because two of our groupmates rolled a 6 on the control die, 7 times and we concluded that 1 more would be unusual for a fair die." 
 
#If a fair die is rolled 20 times, what is the likely number of a 6 resulting?
Following our decision rule, 20/6 is 3.3 repeating, therefore, the likely number of times for a 6 to result, out of 20 rolls, is 3-5. 
#How unusual is it to get 1 more or 1 less than that?
To determine if it is unusual to roll 1 more or 1 less than the likely number of a 6 resulting, depends on the number of rolls. Out of 20, it is not unusual to roll 1 more or 1 less than the likely. 
#How unusual is it to get 2 more or 2 less than that?
Given the previous reasoning, it is not unusual to get 2 more or 2 less than the likely number of a certan number rolling, out of 20 rolls. 
#How unusual is it to get 3 more or 3 less than that?
Out of 20 rolls, it is not unusual to get 3 more or 3 less than the likely number of times of rolling a 6 (although it is borderline!).
